## ✨ What Makes Kandeta Special

🎯 **Finally, Translations That Make Sense**  
Organize your app's text in a clean, searchable interface. Find that specific button label or error message in seconds, not minutes.

⚡ **AI-Powered Speed**  
Connect with your favorite translation services and let AI handle the heavy lifting. Get quality translations in multiple languages while you focus on building great features.

🔍 **Never Lose Track Again**  
Smart filtering and search means you can instantly find any text, whether you remember the ID, the content, or just a few keywords.

🚀 **Works With Your Workflow**  
Import your existing JSON files, make your changes, and export them back. No complex migrations, no vendor lock-in.

📁 **Project-Based Organization**  
Keep different apps separate, manage versions, and collaborate with your team without stepping on each other's toes.

✨ **Beautifully Simple**  
No learning curve, no overwhelming menus. Just open your files, make your changes, and get back to what matters. Translation management shouldn't require a manual.
